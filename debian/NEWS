valgrind (1:3.6.1-5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Starting with this version /usr/lib/valgrind binaries are stripped which
  saves about 150Mb on amd64 for example.

  It's supposed to be unsupported according to valgrind packaging
  instructions[0]. Though preliminary tests tends to show the way Debian
  strips symbols works.

  If you encounter issues with valgrind reports becoming useless try to revert
  to some version before 1:3.6.1-4 (for example from [1]). And if that fixes
  it, this stripping is likely to be the cause.
